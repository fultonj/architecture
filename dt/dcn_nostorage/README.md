# DT: DCN

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the DCN DT, then
please see the
[DCN README in the examples directory](../../examples/dt/dcn/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/dt/dcn/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/dcn/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the DCN DT, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
